# PITheremin #
End-Of-Year Project source code for the PI Theremin.

The PI Theremin is a concept whichi completely uses digital technologies, to provide another solution to the Theremin
interference problem.

The way it will work is that it uses python scripts to get readigns from a hand tracking AI library known as mediapipe.
It then relays the information to OSC messages which are read by Sonic PI, a Digital Audio Interface which generates the sound and tonation for the PI Theremin.
